        <h2>Enforcing Options</h2>

        <p>These options tell JSHint to be more strict towards your code. Use them if you want
        to allow only a safe subset of JavaScript&mdash;very useful when your codebase is shared
        with a big number of developers with different skill levels.</p>

        <table class="zebra-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Name</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="name"><code>bitwise</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This option prohibits the use of bitwise operators such as <code>^</code> (XOR),
                <code>|</code> (OR) and others. There are two reasons why you would want to enable
                this option:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Since JavaScript doesn't have integers (only doulbe precision floating-point
                  numbers) the bitwise operators here is very slow.</li>
                  <li>Bitwise operations are very rare in JavaScript programs and very often
                  <code>&amp;</code> is simply a mistyped <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</li>
                </ol>

            <tr>
              <td class="name"><code>curly</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This option requires you to always put curly braces around blocks in loops
                  and conditionals. JavaScript allows you to omit curly braces when the block
                  consists of only one statement, for example:</p>
<pre>while (day)
  shuffle();</pre>
                <p>However, in some circumstances, it can lead to bugs:</p>
<pre>while (day)
  shuffle();
  sleep(); // You would think that this is a part of your loop, but it is not.</pre>

<p>Generally, unless you are careful, it is safer to require curly braces around all blocks.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td class="name"><code>eqeqeq</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This options prohibits the use of <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> in favor
                of <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>. The former try to coerce values before
                comparing them which can lead to some unexpected results.
                The latter don't do any coercion so they are generally safer.

                If you would like to learn more about type coercion in JavaScript, we recommend

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> even if this option is off, JSHint will check for unsafe
                comparisons like <code>!= null</code> unless option <code>eqnull</code> (see below)
                is turned on.</p>

            <tr>
              <td class="name"><code>forin</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This option requires all <code>for in</code> loops to filter objects' items.
                The <code>for in</code> statement allows for looping through the names of all of
                the properties of an object including those inherited throught the prototype chain.
                This behavior can lead to unexpected items in your object so it is generally
                safer to always filter inherited properties out as shown in the example:</p>
<pre>for (key in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    // We are sure that obj[key] belongs to the object and was not inherited.
  }
}</pre>

                <p>For more in-depth understanding of <code>for in</code> loops in JavaScript,
                read <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/exploring-javascript-for-in-loops/">Exploring JavaScript for-in loops</a> by Angus Croll.</p>

              <td class="name"><code>immed</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This option prohibits the use of immediate function invocations without wrapping
                them in parentheses. Wrapping parentheses assists readers of your code in
                understanding that the expression is the result of a function, and not the function
                itself.</p>

              <td>
                <p>This option prohibits the use of a variable before it was defined. JavaScript
                has function scope only and, in addition to that, all variables are always
                moved&mdash;or hoisted&mdash; to the top of the function. This behavior can lead
                to some very nasty bugs and that's why it is safer to always use variable only after
                they have been explicitly defined.</p>
                <p>For more in-depth understanding of scoping and hoisting in JavaScript,
                read <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting">JavaScript

              <td class="name"><code>newcap</code></td>
              <td>
                <p>This option requires you to capitalize names of constructor functions.
                Capitalizing functions that are intended to be used with <code>new</code> operator
                is just a convention that helps programmers to visually distinguish constructor
                functions from other types of functions to help spot mistakes when using
                <code>this</code>.</p>

                <p>Not doing so won't break your code in any browsers or environments but it will
                be a bit harder to figure out&mdash;by reading the code&mdash;if the function was
                supposed to be used with or without <code>new</code>. And this is important because
                when the function that was intended to be used with <code>new</code> is used without
                it, <code>this</code> will point to the global object instead of a new object.</p>

<pre>function MyConstructor() {
  console.log(this);
}

new MyConstructor(); // -> [MyConstructor]
MyConstructor();     // -> [DOMWindow]
</pre>

                <p>For more in-depth understanding on how <code>this</code> works, read

                <p>This option prohibits the use of <code>arguments.caller</code> and
                <code>arguments.callee</code>. Both <code>.caller</code> and <code>.callee</code>
                make quite a few optimizations impossible so they were deprecated in
                future versions of JavaScript. In fact, EcmaScript 5 forbids the use of
                <code>arguments.callee</code> in strict mode.</p>

                <p>This options warns when you have an empty block in your code. JSLint was
              originally warning for all empty blocks and we simply made it optional. There were
              no studies reporting that empty blocks in JavaScript break your code in any way.</p>

              <td>
                <p>This option prohibits the use of constructor functions for side-effects. Some
                people like to call constructor functions without assigning its result to any
                variable:</p>
                <pre>new MyConstructor();</pre>
                <p>There is no advantage in this approach over simply calling MyConstructor since
                the object that the operator <code>new</code> creates isn't used anywhere so you
                should generally avoid constructors like this one.</p>

              people think that <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> reduces the quality of their
              coding styles and there are programming languages&mdash;such as Python&mdash;that
              go completely without these operators.</p></td>

                <p>If your variable is defined in another file, you can use
                <code>/*global ... */</code> syntaxto tell JSHint about it. See the

                <p>This option requires all functions to run in EcmaScript 5's strict mode.
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode">Strict mode</a> is
              a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript. Strict mode eliminates some
              JavaScript pitfalls that didn't cause errors by changing them to produce errors and it
              fixes mistakes that made it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform certain
              optimizations.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This option enables strict mode for function scope only,
                it <strong>prohibits</strong> the global scoped strict mode because it might break
                third-party widgets on your page. If you really want to use global strict mode,

                Trailing whitespaces can be source of nasty bugs with multi-line strings in

                <p>This option suppresses warnings about missing semicolons. There is a lot of FUD
                about semicolon spreaded by quite a few people in the community. The common myths
                are that semicolons are required all the time (they are not) and that they are
                unreliable. JavaScript has a small and stable rules regarding semicolons that
                is followed by <strong>all</strong> browsers so it is up to you to decide
                whether you should or should not use semicolons in your code.</p>
